@Viewable11,"Mistral's comparison omits CodeQwen. Therefore the comparison is useless. It also omits DeepSeek Coder V2 Lite, which is another reason for it being a worthless comparison",4,2024-07-17 14:27:23

@SahilP2648,"Claude 3.5 Sonnet is still the best for coding, and after that it would be Claude Opus 3.5 so this is kind of irrelevant.",0,2024-07-17 14:27:24
@Viewable11,"¬†@SahilP2648¬† The title of the video is about ""Opensource Coding Model"". Mistral compares its model to open source models. No Claude model is open source.",3,2024-07-18 14:27:24
