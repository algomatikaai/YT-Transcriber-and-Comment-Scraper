you sign five clients specifically from Co email in the past 30 days so walk us through how that happened and like what kind of clients are these and yeah how do you get them to close on your services what's going on guys Andre Hegel Jr here back with another case study interview here with my man alexen what's going on brother what's going on brother all good all good how about you I'm doing great bro I'm really excited to dive in and learn more about you and your business and most importantly the results and the success you've having we were talking a little bit off camera here but you've been blowing up the winds channel in client Ascension talking about how you're signing client left and right from cold email and again I'll say it again I've said it on a lot of the recent interviews but it's a shame that people are writing off cold email as a lead generation strategy that's all of a sudden dead when it's when it's not and so I appreciate you being willing to spend the time with us here today to talk about the recent results that you're seeing here in July 2024 with cold email I think I saw you signed five clients specifically from cold email in the last 30 days so I want to talk all about that with you today exactly exactly perfect happy to share everything awesome brother so tell us a little bit more about who you are and what kind of business you run yeah so my name is Alex Sam I'm in Cyprus right now currently live in London I'm in uni I'm running a business on the side a cold email Legion agency done for you service we essentially work with any type of B2B company or an agency we don't have a specific Niche and we just essentially do all things called email related we set up the whole infrastructure actually launch the campaigns manage inboxes and book these companies calls so it's just an end to-end cold email process that's awesome bro I love getting on interviews with guys like you who use cold email to get clients and then they help their clients get clients through cold email right it's kind of like this this layered thing not it's just really cool because you you do what you say you're going to do for your clients yourself that's how you get business which is a testate to the services that you're offering being you know valuable in the first place and and showing that they actually work so that's really cool to me I think you're telling me a little bit off camera like you're new to the whole cold email game and that's how most people are coming into it like I was new to cold email three or four years ago and right as soon as I learned about it I spent hours learning everything there was to learn like within the first couple of days and then immediately started implementing and testing for myself and my businesses and so what was that experience like learning about cold Emil like how do you hear about it how did you get started yeah so like I definitely had an idea as to what it was because I knew what cold calling was so I could sort of guess what it was and then I think the the fact that I learned all this in client essention just made the whole process a lot more smooth because of the actual modules that we have in kajabi so like the fact that I had everything laid out step by step I don't know if I would have been able to actually learn everything to the extent that I that I did if I didn't have those modules guiding me step by step so I think that really helped and it just made it less it wasn't so overwhelming you know so it was just a really smooth process and the fact that I had all the coaches as well just like answering all my questions immediately just helped me never have any or let's say if I did have any uncertainties they were solved like right away so the whole process was just so smooth that's awesome to hear bro and what about like the community aspect because obviously you're in a community with hundreds of business owners that are also going through those same lessons in kajabi and learning about cold Emil and then going out and implementing cold email on their own so you can learn from just their mistakes or even their success what has that experience been like in the community yeah it's been it's been amazing because you have so many other people so many other business owners who are on the same Journey as you some of them are more you know ahead of you in the journey some of them are I don't know might be behind you but the fact that you're all on the same path it really helps and I think one of the things that really led to to these results that I was able to achieve was like I was a bit of a ghost within the program for like at the beginning and the minute I started engaging more reaching out to people I think I like almost messaged every single person within the program to like actually meet these people see what they do and they've all been able to help me so much not only with cold email with social media with everything I've been able to help them as well and that just 10 xed my growth within the program so like the community aspect was something that I just didn't take too seriously at the beginning and then once I did it was just the results were insane dude that's awesome it's crazy how easily someone can pick up a new skill set or lead generation strategy with just the right tools and access to information and also just the willingness to go all in and and learn about it and implement it and push through the early on failures and roadblocks so I'm happy to hear that you're able to to get to that point and you mention again or I mentioned at the start of the interview you sign five clients specifically from cold email in the last 30 days so walk us through how that happened and like what kind of clients are these and yeah how do you get them to close on on your services yeah so like I think to begin with like I know everything that's being said about cold email now and like I don't know the majority of people think that it's dead or I don't know what else they're saying I've just I think the most important thing is that I stuck to the basics I did a lot of testing the fact that I didn't panic and the fact that I just had I I had this community around me had these coaches I just kept it simple split my inboxes I just did everything that I had to do included my spin TXS just followed my warm-up procedures made my scripts relevant made my lead lists extremely accurate and it was just doing everything that you always had to do I just did that well and I think that I I didn't like come up with some magic potion or anything I literally just did what all the coaches told me to do and like I spoke with Matt a lot with Nick like with all the coaches like whatever they told me to do I just did it that was it now what clients we signed different types of clients marketing agencies software development we was it oh another software development company another marketing agency so it was mostly these types of businesses because that's just what the lead list was for the specific campaign so yeah yeah d That's So Awesome just saying how you showed up to the calls with the guys that have been doing it for a very long time you listen to what they were telling you to do and you did it the right way right you didn't just rush through and implement it and not really focus on quality and I think that's where a lot of people go wrong is they kind of see something surface level they try it really quickly without much effort and then it doesn't work and they're writing it off is like hey this thing just doesn't work period it's definitely harmful to the rest of the market that's out there wanting to find a lead generation strategy that'll work for them and they skip over a cold email because they saw someone talk badly about it when that person really just didn't give it their all and didn't have access to the best tools and and information like we do here in client Ascension and with using tools like Lis kit what about like your experience using I'm sure you use Smart lead at this point you might use Lis kit to build your leads list like what's your Tech stack what have you seen the best results with honestly I just kept it extremely simple just been using this kit for my lead list been using smart lead to send out the actual emails that's pretty much it literally just the these two tools and that's basically it like it's not it's just not complicated like that's it I love your perspective on like it's not complicated at all like we've laid out the Playbook we've given you the exact tools to go sign up for and use because when I first started with cold email like I had to use Apollo million verifier a personalization tool Google spreadsheets a CSV converter put it into the leads like the lead sending tool it was a pain in the neck and so to scale our own campaigns let alone our clients cold email campaigns was not simple and straightforward like it is now with list kit andly you could literally launch the cold email campaign in five to 10 minutes with both those tools if you have the scripts ready to go so that's the cool thing with list kid it's like you probably had no experience using Apollo and didn't have to go through the rigorous you know process of building leads list and verifying leads and and getting rid of the non-verified and so list kit was probably a breeze right you go in there you you do your search and you have your leads ready to go and probably very effective for your agency as well because you have m multiple clients that you have to build leads list for so yeah I guess what's your experience been with list kid and and building multiple leads lists at a time with a tool like that yeah so I think that just going back to what we said previously like a lot of people who say like cold email is dead and whatever they just don't do the basics properly and you asked me this before as well like how I close those clients a lot of them were already using cold email and when I asked them like what their experience was they were just doing all the basics wrong like it's not that they the lead list was wasn't accurate their scripts weren't good they weren't relevant whatever so like it once again it just goes back to the basics but when it comes to to list kit yeah it's been so good like I had an onboarding call as well I've actually booked a couple of calls with the list kit team they actually helped me with a couple of my lead list because obviously I didn't have experience at first so I didn't know I was using just the predefined filters they actually helped me to make it even more accurate and how I can adjust it to what exactly like the exact company and job titles people that I want to Target so it's just been once again it's just been so smooth the the team has been on it any question I had I either booked a call either just used the chat and you know someone responded in like 10 minutes so yeah it's just yeah it's I'm good yeah it's all about it's all about support I think a lot of people get stuck and then they don't really know where to turn to and so just having the the community and the support and access to to calls which anyone that signs up for list kick gets access to the one1 onboarding Calles with our team just like you mentioned there so it's it's a no-brainer just to sign up and and at least learn how to use a tool like list get the right way I think a lot of people spend money on tools and then don't know how to use them which is a big part of the problem and so getting access again to the tools but also the information like I've been saying throughout this interview is so important so that's amazing bro again I love how you just come back to the Simplicity of everything and just being able to turn to different team members and calls that we offer to work through different strategies that you can implement the other thing that I'm super excited about which you'll probably be experiencing soon and testing soon is the intent data feature that we just launched ATL kit I think it's just going to help again give you another competitive advantage over the rest of the marketplace by actually being able to know who's interested in the services you sell it just makes the the messaging in the scripting so much more relevant and you'll avoid you know getting spam complaints when you're reaching out to people that are just not at all interested in what it is you're selling and so I'm excited to hear about the results that come from that the other thing I want to ask you about though is like okay so you do cold email you you send out a bunch of emails that's easy you get someone on the phone like what's been your experience on the sales side right because there's all these marketing channels that you can schedule calls from I've had calls with people from like Facebook ads that had no idea what they booked a call for no idea about our company and what we did and they were so out of our IP and target market that it was aable so what has your experience been with like the quality of calls uh that come through cold email and just like the sales process overall yeah so I think the quality of the sales call always depends on the type of people you're targeting like you also determine the quality of the sales call but I think it's been very it's been really good I'm lucky because my business partner is he's in sales so he really helped me get a script as well that's been really good but the thing is which is another thing that people do with cold emo that really affects their results negatively is that they're just they're ghosts on social media they're not on social media they're not on LinkedIn they don't have a good website so like the reason why these calls were good is because people like I do have a website I do have my landing page I've got a BSL on it um I'm on Twitter I'm on LinkedIn so like these people like what's the first thing you do when you receive a c EMA know you like check on all social media platforms on the internet like where is this guy what does he do exactly so the fact that they could find me everywhere and see exactly what I do just made it a lot easier because they knew exactly what I was doing what I was selling I'm not just this ghost with no profile picture who you know just selling something so yeah it's been really good and they knew exactly what I was doing I think it was like pretty qualified I never had a really tough time and all these people cold email could be useful for their businesses this goes back to the lead list like these are targeted prospects so like yeah it's just been it's been good I'm happy to hear that bro I'm happy to hear that and yeah like going on the sales calls knowing who you're speaking to and and that they're in your ICP and they know what it is you offer and the value of it and then being able to do their due diligence and check your website and see that your website has a vsl and it's updated it's got case studies and you have posts going out on all your social media profiles showing and displaying your expertise in this exact service offering that they're interested in learning more about like it's really hard to compete with someone like you who has all that going for them so Props you for putting that all together in such a short period of time like I I pointed out and so that's what I love about cold email is someone can pick it up and implement it and see and read from the rewards and the benefits very quickly compared to other marketing channels it's very low barrier to entry like you don't need a massive budget like you might need to do a successful paid ads campaign and so I I really want to push more and more people to to try coo as a method to grow their business one of the questions I have last question I have for you really is just like when people don't get results from cold email like what would be your advice to them right because you've probably even had this at your agency where someone gets on a pH call with you and they're like yeah well I've tried this before and it didn't work like why is it going to work this time around like why do you think like it would work now for someone that has tried it before and it didn't work is it because of again I for me I think it's always access to information and tools if you have access to the right information support education trainings Sops and then the right tools to to actually carry all that out then it'll work if not it probably won't just like with anything else but what's your thoughts on that yeah so I mean it's like obviously you're going to stumble upon a lot of problems throughout the way like you're not always going to get these results so the fact that I have a lot of people to turn to like straight away and I couldn't always identify what the issue was so the fact that you know I had people like telling me send me a screenshot of the of your stats and I can like sort of tell you if it's deliverability maybe it's not deliverability it might be the script show me your script show me the lead list who are you targeting oh your script isn't relevant for these types of people so like the fact that I had everyone around me to actually help me I think that was actually the most important thing so I agree with you 100% like access to information access to tools especially with like what's going on now with cold email you have to sort of stay ahead you need to know what's going on and how to adjust to all the changes and I think that's where most people sort of fall behind because they're just not testing enough and that also just goes back to the fact that they don't have the community around them they might not have the coaches the experts or whatever to tell them you know this is what we should try now try test this and so on so I agree with you 110% awesome bro and just for the audience to give them even more value before we we hop off here like what are some things you look at in a cold email campaign to tell whether or not it's on the right track yeah I mean you're definitely going to look at bounce rates for deliverability we ideally like just like Matt says just like all the coaches say we try to keep our bounce rates below sort of three to 4% and instead of like trying to become the ultra Tech guy just sort of burn it and buy a new one you know instead of sort of trying to you know a lot of people that that's what I was trying to do as well like I didn't want to spend an extra 1015 to go and just buy a new domain set it up again just launch it fresh and you try to sort of find ways to convince yourself that this domain is still fine the email account is fine that's the first thing and then obviously we just track we have our numbers for like reply rates positive reply rates and that's just basically it you need volume to be able to actually tell to gather good enough sample size but then it's just once again the basics just like look at the reply rates look at your bounce rates if you're using smart lead every everything is literally right there in front of you for you to analyze and and then from there onwards once again it's just testing so yeah makes sense super helpful and I appreciate you sharing that advice and strategy for people out there maybe already doing cold email and wanting to continue to just push to get results on their own so really really helpful it's great to have you in the community I see poster wins all the time and I think what makes a community even more valuable is having people like you in there who are constantly out there every single single day pushing to just improve the results in your campaigns and not just that but like then go back into the community and share it with others and that's something I really appreciate about guys like you is you understand like this is a huge opportunity for a lot of people and it's not just something to keep to yourself and so you're really out there in communities and also with your clients just helping them get the best results possible through cold email and so we need more guys like you um that are not saying uh out there panicking saying cold Emil is De but instead you know putting Solutions in place and offering people ways to get better results than they're getting now so thank you for that and as a last question brother again thank you for your time it's been it's been great you mentioned a couple of things like client attention and list kit which again at this point like our audience is is familiar with with what we have available to to help them with so links are always in the the video descriptions and whatnot if you have any questions just leave a comment I always monitor the comments and respond back to you guys personally but last thing alexen is where can our audience find you and follow you online to learn more about you know what you're working on and maybe want to work with you or just get in touch and and ask even some more questions yeah so you can definitely find me on Twitter my username is alexand 6z on LinkedIn as well alexans Aran got my website spark leo.com that's also you'll find that on my Twitter my LinkedIn so that's pretty much it that's awesome bro thank you again

the last three or four years and we'll continue pushing and and showing you guys that results are possible even though things change as in any other industry there's still people out there getting
